# US baby names Power BI Dashboard
First of all this is the source of the data I used : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/us-baby-names
The dataset contains National data on the relative frequency of given names in the population of U.S. births where the individual has a Social Security Number 

- **NationalNames**  (1.83m rows)
   - Id
   - Name
   - Year
   - Gender
   - Count
- **StateNames** :  (5.65m rows) 
   - Id
   - Name
   - Year
   - Gender
   - State
   - Count

The data provides information from 1880 to 2014 (NationalNames) and from 1910 to 2014 (StateNames) but I decided to filter from 1940 to 2014 to have a ligther dashboard.
